# SoundMirroring
Unity C# Code that lets you mirror any audio device to any other audio device

I didn't plan on sharing this code until someone asked so it is not the cleanest code but it does work

This uses [CSCore](https://github.com/filoe/cscore) and [libsamplerate](http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/download.html), I provided the compiled binaries here but you can compile them yourself if you prefer.
